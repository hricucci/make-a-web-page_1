	 <div id="whatsHtml>"><h1>What is HTML?</h1></div>
	 <div class="text"><p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), is the languange the browsers can understand and show us somethng we won't.
	 This text for example, was wrote with this languange, where you can just type something or put images, buttons, and personalize them.</p></div>
	 
		<div id="howDoesItWork" ><h1>How does it work? </h1></div>
	 <div class="text" style="margin-bottom: 200px;" ><p>HTML works with <b>Tag</b> and <b>Elements</b>. For example.<br>
	 I can make a word becomes <i>Italic</i>, by using a tag the letter i inside &lt; and &gt;. the element inside these Symbols define the tag, and these tags make the page look like what we want. If i want to jump line in HTML, i cannot just press enter, i need to put a tag that allows the text be be shown in next line.</p>
	 And everything follows the same concepts.</p></div>




	 <div class="lessontittle">Lesson 2</div>

	 <div id="structureHtml"><h1>Structure of HTML document</h1></div>
		<div class="text"><p>In HTML the layout of the page must be all setted, because the computer don't recognize the formatation of the text by itself. You can do it basically in two different ways: It can be setted as a linear thing or a block. The block "creates an invisible box" around the image or text you want, making it stays where you want.</p></div>


			<div id="parentAndChildren"><h1>"Parents and children"</h1></div>
		<div class="text"><p>One important and relevant aspect of HTML is that you can put a parameter inside another. By doing this we can set things as a tree, where we choose who is going inside of who. For example we can put a  list inside another list, organizing the page as we want.</p></div>

		<div id="textEditor"><h1>Text Editors</h1></div>
		<div class="text" style="margin-bottom: 200px;">
		<p>Every tag must me setted exactly as it should be or the page won't be as we want. For that reason when we write the codes it's very usefull to use some Text Editor for programers thar hepls a lot writing the code. They show options for each tag, and in the most of them, there are colors that describe each thing, making a lot easier to see where there is a mistake.</p></div></div>


		<div class="lessontittle">Lesson 3</div>

	 <div id="structureCss"><h1>Easier and more efficient work</h1></div>
		<div class="text"><p>When building a brand new page, there are lots of codes to write, and most of them we may be used several times. And then there is an efficient tool to help in this journey.<br>
			We can use an CSS file for almost all the styles we want in the page. By using CSS we can write some style code and use it as many times as we want to. It helps by avoind wiriting the same thing several times and by avoiding error when repeating the same code.</p></div>


			<div id="css"><h1>CSS</h1></div>
		<div class="text"><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, is basically another document where we write the layout of the HTML. That way we can for example, make a layout for tittles and just by referencing to it, use as many times we want.</p></div>
